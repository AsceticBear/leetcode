Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

1. Brute Force 暴力破解法

2. 峰值法（One pass）， 记录一个最小值 price 值和一个最大 profit 值。

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int prices[]) {
        int minprice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] < minprice)
                minprice = prices[i];
            else if (prices[i] - minprice > maxprofit)
                maxprofit = prices[i] - minprice;
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}
