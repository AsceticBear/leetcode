Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

1. 暴力破解

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        return calculate(prices, 0);
    }

    public int calculate(int prices[], int s) {
        if (s >= prices.length)
            return 0;
        int max = 0;
        for (int start = s; start < prices.length; start++) {
            int maxprofit = 0;
            for (int i = start + 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
                if (prices[start] < prices[i]) {
                    int profit = calculate(prices, i + 1) + prices[i] - prices[start];
                    if (profit > maxprofit)
                        maxprofit = profit;
                }
            }
            if (maxprofit > max)
                max = maxprofit;
        }
        return max;
    }
}

2. One pass

[1, 7, 2, 3, 6, 7, 6, 7]

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1])
                maxprofit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}
